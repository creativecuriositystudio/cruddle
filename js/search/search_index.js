CRUDL provides all of the functionality and information required for CRUDL screens -you just need write the HTML structure of your CRUDL components using the base Cruddle components.\nThe Cruddle library is made up of the following base components:\n\nFormComponent: A component to be used on a create or update screen.\nReadComponent: A component to be used on a view/read screen.\nDeleteComponent: A component to be used on a delete screen.\nListComponent: A component to be used on a list screen.\n\nFor explanation of how to use these components, see below.\nInstallation\nnpm install --save cruddleUsage\nGeneral Concepts\nCruddle aims to separate the definition of each CRUDL screenfrom the actual structure. This means that you definethe filters, sorting, permissions, contextual actions, fields, etc.separate to the HTML structure in Cruddle definitionsand then your component's template turns this into an appropiate HTML structure.\nThere are four types of definitions in Cruddle and they correspond directlyto the available components:\n\nFormDefinition: Defines the functionality of a create/update screen.\nReadDefinition: Defines the functionality of a view/read screen.\nDeleteDefinition: Defines the functionality of a delete screen.\nListDefinition: Defines the functionality of a list screen.\n\nCreate & Update\nIn most applications, a create or update screen will generallyact the same or extremely similar when it comes to UI. To encourage writing minimal code,Cruddle's create and update component are merged into the onecomponent FormComponent. You can still have two separatecomponents that both use the FormComponent if you need functionalityspecific to the create or update screen.\nThe selector for the form component is .The form component takes a FormDefinition, which describeshow the form component actually functions.\nRead\nThe selector for the read component is .The read component takes a ReadDefinition, which describeshow the form component actually functions.\nDelete\nThe selector for the delete component is .The delete component takes a DeleteDefinition, which describeshow the form component actually functions.\nNote that some applications may have the delete screen as a popupon the list screen rather than a separate screen. If that's the case,then the delete component can just be ignored and a global action can beadded to the list component.\nList\nThe selector for the list component is .The delete component takes a DeleteDefinition, which describeshow the form component actually functions.\nDocumentatation\nThe API documentation generated using TypeDocis available online.\nTo generate API documentation from the code into the docs directory, run:\nnpm run docsTesting\nTo execute the test suite run:\nnpm run testLicense\nThis project is licensed under the MIT license.
